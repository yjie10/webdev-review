### Reduce
- reduce is a great method to use for two things:
  > we want to end up with one value (e.g. summing up all values in an array)


- takes two arguments:
  > first argument is a function, that has two parameters: 
    I. accumulator: accumulated value of calling this function on every element before the one we are currently on. 
    II. second parameter is the element itself. 
  > second argument is the initial value of the accumulator;
