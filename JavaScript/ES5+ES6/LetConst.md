# Let + Const

- with __var__, we were only able to create a scope within a function. 
- with __let__, scope can be created even within a if-statement; everytime it is wrapped with a curly bracket {}, it creates a scope. 
- with __const__ (constant) variable, you are not allowed to reassign, it cannot be updated. Properties can be changed, but no reassign allowed.
