Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
// good for selecting a group of elements

#id
// similar to class but is used to identify a single element

*
// universal selector, selects all elements

element
element, element

element element 
// [element1 element2] select element2 that are inside of element1

element > element
// [element1 > element2] select element2 that are only child of element1

  e.g.
  CSS - h2 > p
  
  HTML 1: Will NOT apply because <p>'s parent is <div> and not <h2>
  <h2>Home
    <div>
      <p>Homepage</p>
    </div>
  </h2>

  HTML 2: Will apply because <p>'s parent is <h2>
  <h2>Home
    <p>Homepage</p>
  </h2>

element + element
// [element1 + element2] select element2 that is immediately after element1

:hover

:last-child
:first-child
// just as what the name suggests

!important (not recommended)
// overwrites all other rules, basically erases the cascading style sheet rules

What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
